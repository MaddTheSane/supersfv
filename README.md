# SuperSFC - File integrity verifier

## Original description from MacUpdate

SuperSFV is a simple file verification program for Mac OS X. It has an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, somewhat influenced by Transmission's, and is released under the GNU GPL v2. Although I admit the source may be a bit sloppy, it is included in the download.

SuperSFV tries to add on to the SFV format by allowing the MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms to be used for verification as well as the standard CRC32. The format is still shallow, however.

### What's New

Version 1.2:
* Updated the interface to scroll down to the last entry as per Lucky's request
* Cleaned up the toolbar code and nib a little bit
* Once again, happy halloween ;)
